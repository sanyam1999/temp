/*
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();

VS CODE TOLD TO PREFIX ALL UNUSED ARGUMENTS IN A FUNCTION WITH AND UNDERSCORE (AS I DID BELOW )
AFTER PUTTING THE UNDERSCORE BEFORE ARGUMENTS, IF YOU TRY TO USE THEM, IT WILL THROW AN ERROR THAT YOU ARE USING AN UNDEFINED VARIABLE/FUNCTION ETC..

app.use((_req, _res, next) => { console.log("In the middleware"); next(); });

app.use('/add-prod',(_req, res, _next) => {
        console.log("In add prod");
        SENDING RESPONSE NOW TO PAGE
        res.send('<h1>At add product page</h1>');  THIS SEND METHOD IS DIFFRENT FROM WRITE METHOD, IT SETS HEADER FOR US AUTOMATICALLY!
        next();
 });

WE CAN EVEN OMIT THE NEXT ARGUMENT IN FUCTION AS IT IS LAST ARG
app.use('/',(_req, res) => {
        console.log("In another middleware");
        SENDING RESPONSE NOW TO PAGE
        res.send('<h1>Hello from express</h1>'); THIS SEND METHOD IS DIFFRENT FROM WRITE METHOD, IT SETS HEADER FOR US AUTOMATICALLY!
        next();
 });

app.listen(3000);
THE LINE "app.listen()" DOES SAME WORK AS 2 LINES BELOW IT CREATES SERVER FUNCTION AND BY LISTEN METHOD IT DIRECTS US TO THE PORT!!
const server = http.createServer(app);
server.listen(3000);
NOW WE DONT EVEN NEED TO IMPORT HTTP IN 1st LINE OF CODE
